TODO (workflow) for TASKS (p(eye)visstimmer, peyefv)...

Visual stimulation does:

0) Calibration/connection to eye trackers and other streams (external cams?)
 -- Realsense etc.?
 -- I.e. sending required sync signals?

1) presentation of visual stimuli (in coordinate frame).
 -- Selection of "task" by experimenter, start task (psychopy) and record
    exact stimulus timings/calls which were displayed to a log file.
 -- allow setting of task "parameters" (i.e. visual stimulation parameters).
    for gabor patches let them "click" on where to put it etc.?

## Issue is to automatically pop up the task (ON THE CORRECT SCREEN)
   when the GUI task button is clicked, and to MAINTAIN EYE TRACKING?
   Issue is that eye tracking connection must be recreated every time? And
   copy of EDF happens each time? I want to stream head position raw too?

## Interface with OBS stream capture or grab part of stream showing eyepos?
##  Automatically detect "bad" data as jumpy?


## Display gaze data immediately, with interaction via graph, and
   on/off of each line. Then, print to PDF (or CSV?) at current granularity?
   Let them do that after I guess? Auto-name CSV?


## REV: todo, compute optic flow (estimated rotation based on disparity (not available) and optic flow left/right).



KEYBOARD:


psychtoolbox and iohub don't care what window is active, collect all data?!

event.getKeys() only records with STIMULUS WINDOW is active.

## Problem try to "generalize" everything. Best to just say what
## VERSION (git?) of software was used for experiment, so can check
## for any bugs etc.  of that exact version...


## Would like to check OBS recording of screen from eyelink, but can't due to not being monitor if it is running on laptop...fuk.



## Todo for real:

1) take windows laptop to try to set option for eye videos?
2) python interface for start/stop tobii g3 data?
