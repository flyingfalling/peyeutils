## Utils for making plots of gaze (and other stuff)
# Useful for summarizing various types of data.


## Basic line plot. Given DF, and start/end times, plot traces of given columns.
##  This is "static" plotting, e.g. creates PDF files, and downsamples to resolution (REV: How?)

## Plots at given "scale" (one "line" is X seconds), and specification of Y-scale (limits).

## Allow plots of "multi-axes" separately as well (e.g. plot vertical and horizontal on separate sub-plots)

## Allow adding additional "event" markers as lines or dots on a separate axis below...
## (allow for multiple events, e.g. classifications of different things, saccs, drifts, fixations, etc...)

## So, need to combine same naming for events between saccade detectors...


## Do it for other (AHRS, e.g. gyro/accel), pose as well?

## Can add additional parameters on top, e.g. beginning/end of specific events (videos), block, etc.


## Need way of specifying title (name, params, etc.)

## Other utils for e.g. saccade directions, distribution within 'screen' (or DVA), heatmaps, event summary (e.g. velocity/time plots),
##  saccade-over-time plots, gaze-over-time, array of images...


## Give list of plots, or multiple plots on long page? Usually just put on A4-size page...



## Need a way of "summarizing" for individual "trial" versus multi-trial. Regardless of source...?

## REV: need definitions of "direction" of axes (e.g. NWU).
